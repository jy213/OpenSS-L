# OpenSS-L

## Credits and Acknowledgments
We have incorporated or modified code from the following projects:
- Code related to szero-shot segmentation was derived from [openscene](https://github.com/pengsongyou/openscene).
- Multiview fusion have been adapted from [OpenSeg](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/detection/projects/openseg).
- We utilize [MinkowskiEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine) for handling 3D spatial operations.

We are thankful to the developers and maintainers of these projects for their invaluable work.
