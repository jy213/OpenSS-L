# OpenSS-L
Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Cloud
## Credits and Acknowledgments
We have incorporated and modified code from the following projects:
- Code related to zero-shot segmentation was derived from [openscene](https://github.com/pengsongyou/openscene).
- Multiview fusion has been adapted from [OpenSeg](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/detection/projects/openseg).
- We utilize [MinkowskiEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine) for handling 3D spatial operations.
- Skip attention mechanism is modified from [3D_Attention_UNet](https://github.com/mobarakol/3D_Attention_UNet?tab=readme-ov-file).

We are thankful to the developers and maintainers of these projects for their invaluable work.
